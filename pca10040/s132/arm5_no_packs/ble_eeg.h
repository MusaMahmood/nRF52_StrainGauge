 * @brief Biopotential Measurement Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Biopotential Measurement Service with the Voltage characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the Biopotential Measurement Service and Voltage characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack dataBISe. Optionally it can also add a Report Reference descriptor
 *          to the Battery Level characteristic (used when including the Biopotential Measurement Service in
 *          the HID service).
 *
 *          If specified, the module will support notification of the Battery Level characteristic
 *          through the ble_eeg_battery_level_update() function.
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Biopotential Measurement Service will
 *          generate Biopotential Measurement Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the Biopotential Measurement Service module by calling
 *       ble_eeg_on_ble_evt() from the from the @ref ble_stack_handler callback.
